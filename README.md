## üîß Technical Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Protocol Architecture

The protocol follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[LoanFi] --> B[Borrowing]
    B --> C[Lending]
    C --> D[HealthFactor]
    D --> E[CoreStorage]
    A --> F[LiquidationEngine]
    F --> G[LiquidationCore]
    G --> H[Getters]
    A --> I[LiquidationAutomation]
    I --> J[Chainlink Automation]
    F --> K[SwapLiquidatedTokens]
    K --> L[Uniswap V3]
```

This architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Upgradability potential
- Gas efficiency
- System modularity
- Robust security model

### üìä Core Protocol Layer
The protocol's core contracts follow a carefully designed inheritance pattern, building from base storage up through complex functionality. Each contract layer adds specific capabilities while maintaining a clean separation of concerns and minimal storage overhead.

üè¶ **LoanFi.sol**: Main protocol entry point and orchestrator
   - Central access point for all protocol operations
   - Permission management and access control
   - Cross-contract orchestration

üíæ **CoreStorage.sol**: Base layer handling state management and access control
   - Optimized storage patterns for gas efficiency
   - Secure state management system
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Upgradeable storage layout
   - Event-driven state updates
   - Cross-contract data consistency

üí∏ **Lending.sol & Borrowing.sol**: - Efficient lending & borrowing mechanisms
   - Secure collateral management
   - Precise accounting system
   - Core lending and borrowing functionality:
      1. Users deposit supported ERC20 tokens as collateral
      2. System calculates borrowing capacity based on collateral value
      3. Users can borrow assets up to their allowed limit
      4. Health factors are continuously monitored

‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π **HealthFactor.sol**: Risk assessment and position health calculations
   - Health factors are continuously monitored using Chainlink price feeds
   - Sophisticated health factor calculations
   - Multi-collateral risk assessment
   - Real-time position/priceFeed monitoring
   - Liquidation threshold management

üí∞ **Withdraw.sol**: Secure collateral withdrawal management
   - Advanced withdrawal safety features:
      - Real-time position validation
      - Health factor verification
      - Slippage-protected withdrawals
   - Atomic execution guarantees:
      - State updates before transfers
      - Transaction rollback on failure
      - CEI pattern implementation
      - Reentrancy protection
   - Flexible withdrawal options:
      - Partial position closure
      - Cross-collateral withdrawals
      - Batch processing support
      - Gas-optimized operations
   - Risk management integration:
      - Pre-withdrawal health checks
      - Post-withdrawal position validation
      - Liquidation threshold monitoring

### üí´ Innovative Liquidation System
The protocol features a dual-mode liquidation system designed to maintain stability in all market conditions:

#### üåä Waterfall Liquidation System
The protocol implements a sophisticated three-tier liquidation mechanism:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Unhealthy Position] --> B{Health Factor < 1.0?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Standard Liquidation]
    C --> D{Sufficient Primary Bonus?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Execute Standard Liquidation]
    D -->|No| F[Waterfall Collection]
    F --> G{Sufficient Total Bonus?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Multi-Collateral Liquidation]
    G -->|No| I[Protocol Automation]
```

‚öîÔ∏è **LiquidationCore.sol**: Market-Driven Liquidations
   - Advanced liquidation logic for external liquidators
   - Users must maintain a minimum collateralization ratio of 200%
   - When a position's health factor drops below 1, it becomes eligible for liquidation
   - External liquidators can repay a portion of the user's debt
   - In return, they receive the equivalent collateral plus a 10% bonus
      - Competitive market-based mechanism
   - This incentivizes quick resolution of unhealthy positions

‚öôÔ∏è **LiquidationEngine.sol**: Core liquidation calculations and bonus distribution
   - Advanced dual-mode liquidation system
   - Automated position monitoring
   - Efficient bonus distribution mechanism
   - If the liquidated collateral asset has experienced significant price decline:
     - The protocol automatically sources the liquidator's bonus from the user's other deposited collateral
     - This ensures liquidators remain incentivized even during single-asset market stress

ü§ñ **LiquidationAutomation.sol**: Automation Layer

- Chainlink Automation integration:
      - In extreme market conditions (such as collateral flash crashes or others) where user collateral cannot cover the standard bonus:
         - The protocol's automated systems take over
         - Positions are automatically liquidated to protect protocol solvency
         - Remaining healthy collateral is efficiently redistributed
         - Chainlink Automation ensures timely execution

The protocol implements an innovative self-sustaining automation mechanism:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Liquidation Event] --> B[Protocol Fee Collection]
    B --> C[Token Conversion]
    C --> D[LINK Token Reserve]
    D --> E[Chainlink Automation]
    E --> F[Position Monitoring]
    F --> A
```

- Automated position management ensures protocol solvency
   - Converted LINK tokens automatically fund Chainlink Automation
   - Maintains continuous upkeep registration
   - Ensures uninterrupted position monitoring
   - Self-adjusts funding based on network conditions
   - No manual intervention needed
  - Continuous system operation

- *Automated Monitoring*: Continuous position health checking

- *Batch Processing*: Gas-efficient position management & monitoring

üí± **SwapLiquidatedTokens.sol**: 
   - Efficient token swapping via Uniswap V3
   - Advanced slippage protection:
      - Dynamic minimum output calculation
      - Real-time price feed validation
      - Conservative 2% slippage buffer
      - MEV attack mitigation
   - Sophisticated swap routing:
      - Multi-hop path optimization
      - Gas-efficient route selection
      - Liquidity depth analysis
      - Best execution guarantees
   - Value preservation mechanisms:
      - USD-based calculations for precision
      - Cross-token value normalization
      - Price impact monitoring
      - Failed swap protection
   - Protocol safety features:
      - Atomic swap execution
      - State validation pre/post swap
      - Circuit breakers for extreme conditions
