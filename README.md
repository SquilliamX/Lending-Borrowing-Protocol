# üè¶ LoanFi Protocol

LoanFi is an advanced decentralized lending protocol that enables users to deposit collateral, borrow assets, and participate in efficient liquidations. Built with security, scalability, and capital efficiency in mind, LoanFi implements sophisticated risk management and automated liquidation mechanisms.

### Supported Assets
The protocol currently supports three major assets:
- Wrapped Ether (WETH)
- Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
- Chainlink (LINK)

### Collateralization and Risk Management
- Users must maintain a minimum collateralization ratio of 200%
- Health factors are continuously monitored using Chainlink price feeds
- Positions below the required ratio become eligible for liquidation

### Innovative Liquidation System
The protocol features a dual-mode liquidation system designed to maintain stability in all market conditions:

1. **Standard Liquidations**
   - When a position's health factor drops below 1, it becomes eligible for liquidation
   - External liquidators can repay a portion of the user's debt
   - In return, they receive the equivalent collateral plus a 10% bonus
   - This incentivizes quick resolution of unhealthy positions

2. **Advanced Bonus Collection**
   - If the liquidated collateral asset has experienced significant price decline:
     - The protocol automatically sources the liquidator's bonus from the user's other deposited collateral
     - This ensures liquidators remain incentivized even during single-asset market stress
     - The bonus collection follows a proportional distribution across available collateral

3. **Protocol-Managed Liquidations**
   - In extreme market conditions (such as collateral flash crashes or others) where user collateral cannot cover the standard bonus:
     - The protocol's automated systems take over
     - Positions are automatically liquidated to protect protocol solvency
     - Remaining healthy collateral is efficiently redistributed
     - Chainlink Automation ensures timely execution

This multi-layered approach ensures:
- Protocol stability in all market conditions
- Continuous liquidation incentives
- Protection against flash crashes
- Efficient capital utilization

```

The protocol follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Protocol Layer
- **LoanFi**: Main protocol entry point and orchestrator
- **CoreStorage**: Base layer handling state management and access control
- **Lending/Borrowing**: Core lending and borrowing functionality
- **HealthFactor**: Risk assessment and position health calculations

#### Liquidation Layer
- **LiquidationEngine**: Advanced liquidation logic with dual-mode system
- **LiquidationCore**: Core liquidation calculations and bonus distribution
- **SwapLiquidatedTokens**: Efficient token swapping via Uniswap V3

#### Automation Layer
- **LiquidationAutomation**: Chainlink Automation integration
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous position health checking
- **Batch Processing**: Gas-efficient position management

#### External Integrations
- **Chainlink Price Feeds**: Real-time price data
- **Chainlink Automation**: Automated liquidations
- **Uniswap V3**: DEX integration for token swaps

This architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Upgradability potential
- Gas efficiency
- System modularity
- Robust security model

3. Users can borrow assets up to their allowed limit
4. Health factors are continuously monitored

### ‚ö° Liquidation Process
1. **Market-Driven Liquidations**
   - External liquidators repay user debt
   - Receive collateral plus bonus incentive
   - Competitive market-based mechanism

2. **Protocol Liquidations**
   - Activated during market stress
   - Automated position management
   - Ensures protocol solvency
